/// The client is deliberately feature agnostic: it claims the session topic on the application-wide
/// <c>WSConnection</c>, negotiates its identity through the <see cref="IRegisterSessionCommand"/> and
/// dispatches the messages it receives by their <c>type</c>. What a given type means is the business
